When a _GitHub Actions workflow_ that had been working fine for months suddenly failed, I went down a familiar rabbit hole of false assumptions, vague errors, and misleading logs. This post details the troubleshooting journey, the kind that initially screams ***‚Äúrunner environment change,‚Äù*** but ends in a quiet whisper: ***‚Äúyour token expired.‚Äù***

## Context: Automation That Moved üêõ Issues
For context, I had a GitHub Actions workflow using `gh` (GitHub CLI) to automatically move issues labeled `bug` into a "Bugs" column on my GitHub Project board (#6). This workflow ran fine for months‚Äîuntil mid-April 2025, when it silently failed.

![Context Timeline Infographic](context-timeline.png "Context Timeline Infographic")

- **Workflow Name:** `üêõ Auto Bug Column Management`
- **Purpose:** Move issues labeled `bug` to a "Bugs" column in GitHub Projects (Project #6)
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions, `gh` CLI, shell scripting, PAT-based auth
- **Initial State:** Everything worked smoothly until mid-April 2025

## Initial Suspect: A Changing Environment

Like many others, I use `ubuntu-latest` for my GitHub Actions runners for convenience. Around the time my workflow failed (mid-to-late April 2025), I noticed warnings appearing in my Actions logs about `ubuntu-latest` preparing to point to the new `ubuntu-24.04` LTS, updating from `ubuntu-22.04`.

{{< screenshot src="ubuntu-latest-warning.png" alt="GitHub Actions warning about ubuntu-latest" >}}

This seemed like the obvious culprit. Runner environment changes are a common source of workflow failures. I also checked the runner image software lists (like those tracked in actions/runner-images issues, e.g., #10636) and noted potential differences in pre-installed software, including the gh CLI version itself (my local gh 2.68.1 vs. runner versions potentially being 2.69.0 or 2.70.0).

My first logical step was to eliminate this variable. I updated my workflow YAML:

```YAML
jobs:
  move_bug_issues:
    # ...
    # runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Changed from this
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04  # To this
    # ...
```
I reran the workflow, confident this would likely resolve the issue.

## Hitting a Wall: The Cryptic Error

Pinning the runner to `ubuntu-22.04` didn't fix it. The workflow failed again, specifically at the step designed to find the project item ID associated with the labeled issue:

```YAML
- name: Retrieve Project Item
        id: get-item
        run: |
          ITEM_ID=$(
            gh project item-list "6" \ # Project Number 6
              --owner "socrabytes" \   # My username
              --limit 100 \
              --format json \
              --jq ".items[] | select(.content.number == $ISSUE_NUMBER) | .id"
          )
          # ... rest of script ...
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          OWNER: "socrabytes"
          ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          PROJECT_NUMBER: "6"
```

{{< screenshot src="github-actions-error.png" alt="GitHub Actions error message" >}}

The error message wasn't immediately helpful regarding the runner environment: unknown owner type. Why would it suddenly not know the owner type for "socrabytes"? This didn't feel like a gh version compatibility issue on the surface.

## Isolating the Variable: Local üÜö Remote Testing

If it wasn't the runner OS or (maybe) the `gh` version difference, I needed to confirm the command itself was still valid.

1. **Test Locally (Current Version):** I ran the equivalent `gh project item-list` command on my local machine, which had `gh version 2.68.1` installed via Homebrew. **Result: It worked perfectly.**
2. **Test Locally (Upgraded Version):** To further rule out a breaking change in newer `gh` versions, I upgraded my local CLI (`brew upgrade gh`) to `gh version 2.71.1`. I ran the command again locally. **Result: It *still* worked perfectly.**

This was a critical finding. If the command worked locally with both the older version *and* a version newer than the one on the runner, the `gh` version number itself was highly unlikely to be the direct cause. The problem had to be specific to the GitHub Actions execution **context**.

## Digging Deeper: Checking Authentication in Actions

My workflow uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) stored as a secret (`secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN`) to authenticate `gh` commands, allowing it to modify my project board. Although I knew the PAT *should* be valid (it hadn't been changed recently), the next logical step was to explicitly verify authentication *within the runner environment*.

I added a simple debug command to the failing step: `gh auth status`.

```YAML
- name: Retrieve Project Item
        id: get-item
        run: |
          echo "gh cli version: $(gh --version)" # Added for good measure
          echo "Debugging OWNER: $OWNER"
          echo "Checking auth status:"          # <-- Added this line
          gh auth status                      # <-- Added this line

          # Original command follows...
          ITEM_ID=$(
            gh project item-list "$PROJECT_NUMBER" # ... etc
          )
          # ...
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_TOKEN }}
```
## The "Aha!" Moment: The Real Culprit

The output from this debug step in the Actions log was crystal clear:
```CLI
gh cli version: gh version 2.70.0 (2025-04-15)
https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.70.0
Debugging OWNER: socrabytes
Checking auth status:
github.com
  X Failed to log in to github.com using token (GH_TOKEN)
  - Active account: true
  - The token in GH_TOKEN is invalid.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

There it was: **"The token in GH\_TOKEN is invalid."** The `unknown owner type` error was simply a downstream effect of `gh` failing to authenticate properly *before* it could even process the project and owner details.

**The Resolution: A Simple Token Refresh**

Why was the token invalid? I checked my repository secrets ‚Äì the `PROJECT_TOKEN` secret itself showed "Last updated 4 months ago".

**(Optional: Insert Image `image_597009.png` here, showing the secrets list)**

However, the "last updated" time for the *secret storage* doesn't reflect the *PAT's expiration date*. PATs are generated with specific lifetimes (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days, or custom). It was almost certain my PAT, likely created with a 90-day expiry, had simply expired.

The fix was straightforward:

1. Go to GitHub Developer Settings -&gt; Personal access tokens.
2. Find the relevant (likely expired) token.
3. Regenerate the token, ensuring it had the necessary `project` scopes. I chose a new 90-day expiration.
4. Copy the new token value.
5. Go back to the `youtube-digest` repository Settings -&gt; Secrets and variables -&gt; Actions.
6. Update the `PROJECT_TOKEN` secret with the new token value.

After updating the secret, I re-ran the workflow, and it executed perfectly.

**Lessons Learned & Takeaways**

This half-day troubleshooting journey reinforced several key points:

- **Debug Systematically:** Don't get locked onto the first hypothesis, even if initial evidence seems strong (like runner update warnings). Methodically eliminate variables.
- **Leverage Local Testing:** Comparing behavior locally versus in CI/CD is crucial for pinpointing environment-specific issues.
- **Verify Authentication Early:** When CI/CD tools interact with APIs, especially if encountering strange errors, explicitly check the authentication status (`gh auth status` in this case) early in the debugging process.
- **Error Messages Can Mislead:** The initial `unknown owner type` error sent me down the wrong path initially. The real error was hidden until authentication was explicitly checked.
- **Manage Credential Lifecycles:** PATs expire! This incident highlighted the need for proactive management. Setting calendar reminders or documenting expiration dates is crucial, even for solo projects.

**Conclusion**

While the root cause ‚Äì an expired PAT ‚Äì was operationally simple, the path to diagnosing it involved navigating misleading clues and systematically ruling out other potential causes. It was a valuable reminder that sometimes the most obvious environmental changes aren't the culprit, and checking foundational aspects like authentication is key. Hopefully, sharing this journey helps someone else who encounters a similarly confusing workflow failure!
