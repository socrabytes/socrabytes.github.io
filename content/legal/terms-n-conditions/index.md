## User Content
### Comments and Contributions

Our commenting system is powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which leverages [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) to enable visitors to leave comments and reactions using their GitHub accounts.

**How It Works:**

- **GitHub Authentication:** Users must authenticate using their GitHub accounts to post comments, ensuring accountability and reducing spam.
- **Data Storage:** All comments are stored within GitHub Discussions, eliminating the need for a separate database and simplifying data management.
- **Moderation:** Comment moderation is conducted directly through GitHub's interface, providing a familiar environment for repository maintainers.

**User Representations and Warranties:**

- You are solely responsible for your User Content.
- You represent that you have all necessary rights to submit the User Content.
- Your User Content does not infringe any third-party intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or violate any laws.
- You agree to comply with GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to monitor and remove any User Content that we deem inappropriate, offensive, or in violation of these Terms.
